# Overview

Compass has three major concept when it comes to data ingestion: Asset, Type, and Service.

Asset is essentially an arbitrary JSON object that represent a metadata of a specific service with a specific type.

Type defines a ‘type’ of an asset and it is pre-defined. There are currently 4 supported types in Compass: `table`, `job`, `dashboard`, and `topic`.
 
Service defines the application name that the asset was coming from. For example: `biquery`, `postgres`, etc. If you wanted to push data for `bigquery` dataset\(s\) to Compass, you would need to first define the ‘`bigquery`’ service in compass.

Some features that compass has:
* [Asset Tagging](./asset#tagging-an-asset)
* [User](./user.md)
* [Discussion](../guides/discussion.md)
* [Starring](../guides/starring.md)

## Discussion
Compass supports discussion feature. User could drop comments in each discussion. Currently, there are three types of discussions `issues`, `open ended`, and `question and answer`. Depending on the type, the discussion could have multiple possible states. In the current version, all types only have two states: `open` and `closed`. A newly created discussion will always be assign an `open` state. More detail about [Discussion](../guides/discussion.md).

## Starring
Compass allows a user to stars an asset. This bookmarking functionality is introduced to increase the speed of a user to get information. There is also an API to see which users star an asset (stargazers). More detail about [Starring](../guides/starring.md).
